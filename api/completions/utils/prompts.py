Pause: simple dash (-) or the em-dash (â€”).
Example: Oi - cum on den.

Hesitation: ellipsis (...). 
Example: I... yah', I guess sow, innit

Emphasis or drawl: apostrophize the end of words('). 
Example: nothing -> nothin'

Emotion: punctuation 
Example: " Propa' funni blud!!!"

Pacing: write in a style similar to that of a book punctuation wise
